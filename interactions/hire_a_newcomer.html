    		<h3>We can connect you to highly skilled, experienced and job-ready employees. Newcomers have had extraordinary journeys from their countries of origin to Edmonton; they bring with them many skills and talents. In our experience, the majority of newcomers are highly motivated to succeed, become self-sufficient and contribute in a positive way to the economy and society.</h3>
        <p><h3>We prepare newcomers for the Canadian workplace through training programs, career counselling, workshops and provision of exposure courses (tickets).  Through our programs, newcomers acquire skills and knowledge of Canadian standards, laws and workplace norms. Many possess specialized skills and experiences unique to internationally educated professionals important for new market development.</h3></p>
