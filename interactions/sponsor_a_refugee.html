    		<h3>Sponsoring a refugee or a refugee family is an extremely rewarding and meaningful process but it can also be confusing and time-consuming. If you are considering sponsoring a refugee, we are able to support you in your decision making and with navigation of the complex guidelines. If you are in the process of sponsoring a refugee, we offer advice and moral support throughout the spectrum of our sponsorship period â€“ from pre-arrival to the end of the first year, and beyond.</h3>
