        <h3 class="<!--#echo var="color" --> nested">SETTLEMENT SERVICES IN SCHOOLS</h3>
        <p>One of the first steps taken by newcomer families is to enroll their children in school. Children are then faced with their own unique integration challenges: they need to make new friends, learn English and understand the curriculum content that is designed for the Alberta context. For newcomer parents, their expected role in their child’s education in Canada often differs from that of their country of origin. We work to make schools welcoming spaces for newcomer parents and children through cultural brokering, family counselling and academic supports. We work in schools to facilitate communication and establish meaningful connections between newcomer families, their communities and the school system in Alberta.</p>

        <h3 class="<!--#echo var="color" --> nested">HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK</h3>
        <p>We listen to school administrators and parents to determine what the needs are on a student by student basis. We have established relationships with many schools in the Edmonton Public School Board (EPSB) but we are always on call from any school or parent who needs our services. As demand for services changes from year to year, so do the schools in which we work.</p>
